One of the more important things in this program is automatic sanitization of text.
By testing the StyleTTS voice generation with multiple text I've found following things that have to be cleaned in order for voice to be nice to listen:
  1. Code blocks and single lines - reading them aloud is not clear and often confusing. Can be replaced with simple description prepared by LLM
  2. Links to websites - very unclear when read aloud, often contain strange characters. 
    Should be removed or replaced with description, made by LLM or even single function, for example "Link to domain facebook.com"
  3. Dash character: "-". Just remove it, it's often found in text, but the way every TTS reads it sounds sooo wrong. It would be better if it was ignored
  4. Other special characters - check what effect could they have and remove those that cause bad sounding things.
  5. A bit different topic, but in the online demo there are sometimes some unpleasent noises. 
    I have to find what causes them (maybe some characters, possibly invisible, or generating long content at once?) and try to fix it. 
    Maybe even try some noise detection and automatic removal solution on created voice file
  6. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ this "emoji" xD
  7. Also I should check normal emojis
  8. spaces between the sentences, as their lack may cause some weird sounds
