High level overwiev of what has to be done for YarnYap - article to speech prgram, that will convert article or reddit thread into youtube video
  0. [x] Create a basic docker configuration with docker-compose, so the software can be run easily
  1. [x] Create Backend component and database, create simple endpoint for adding url to database
  2. [x] Create a background worker, make the basic mechanism of fetching the urls from database
  3. [ ] Define cleaning mechanism requirements, with basic manual tests using the styletts engine
  4. [ ] Implement cleaning mechanism in the background worker
  5. [ ] Implement splitter mechanism, that will split text into chunks which can be sent to the voice generating service
  6. [ ] Create a service that will actually generate voice from text
  7. [ ] Use the voice generating service in background worker, also implement mechanism for splitting the text into chunks which can be processed at once
  7. [ ] Define and create an API for this speech generating service
  8. [ ] Create a frontend in VUE js


Other things todo:
  - [ ] make the list jobs endpoint return ids, that are visible in swagger


===================================================
Old version of project todos, might still be useful:


  1. Extracting text from text only article
    [ ] choose library for fetching text
    [ ] choose how to sanitize text
    [ ] implement text sanitization
  2. Extracting text from reddit thread, going only to n-th depth level of comments, and assignemnt of available voice to username
    [ ] I have to find the best option for this, I know some command line tools and libraries, but I have to check how they will handle the amount of traffic I want to have (single person, few times a day).
  3. Creating API that will generate voice from text with tortoise TTS
    - has to split long text into multiple lines by sentences, process sentences separately and then combine result into one file
  4. Expanding API with endpoints for cleaning the text from things that will not sound good with voice, like code or raw data - using some local llm
    - problematic things in text:
      - numbers - has to be converted into words, like 42 -> fourty two
      - abbreviations - they had to be written with spaces in order for tortoise TTS to read them properly, like GPU -> G P U
      - special characters - tortoise tts handles only some essential special characters, like . , ! ? Other special characters like " ' etc should be removed
      - links - they will be a mess when read by tortoise tts, they should be removed, maybe replaced with short note describing the link
      - code snippets - especially when they are multiline, they will sound bad. They should be replaced by simple description of the code, made by some local LLM
  5. Generating images for the video
  6. Uploading videos to YouTube, maybe also other platforms
    - remember about adding links to original article/reddit thread to video description
    - create and use generic video description, showing how this video was generated, linking this program
